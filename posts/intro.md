Yes, yes, I know. I've been delaying this for a while now but it's time I start open-sourcing my writing. As a young VC, my day-to-day largely involves optimizing cognitive energy across thematic research, sourcing, and diligence. I've thought long and hard about what defines success in VC. For myself at least, the answer lies in how much I love the work that I do. This is measured by the time I spend learning and refining my learnings through conversations with others.

This repository is meant to house the distillations of my learnings. It's intended to invite all types of reactions or feedback.

Without further ado, here we go!
