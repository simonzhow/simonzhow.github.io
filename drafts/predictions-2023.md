In a blink of an eye, we are already three weeks into 2023. A lot has already been said about the current state of venture markets so I will deliberately choose to avoid this topic in this post. Rather, I'd like to spend a moment to enumerate what areas within developer tools that I'll be paying close attention to this year:

- Zig
- Rust
- Nix
- WebGPU
- Platform eng
- Applied AI dev tools
- SQLite
- React native vs. Flutter (<https://shorebird.dev/>)
- Wasm
- React framework wars (e.g., Expo, Next, Remix)
- Unbundling of the cloud (e.g., AWS) to bundling of the cloud (e.g., Railway)
